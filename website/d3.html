            <p>Drone racing is the new form of aerial combat, and it's big. A unique combination of PC gaming, gladiatorial motorsport, Hollywood movie effects and adrenaline.</p>

            <h3>Getting Started in Racing</h3>
            <p>Nearly all drones used for racing have quad rotors. They are lightweight, stripped-down machines with the absolute bare minimum of equipment. Every drone-racing pilot offers the same advice: start with a small, inexpensive drone like the Hubsan X4.</p>
            
            <h3>FPV - First Person View</h3>
            <p>At the heart of drone racing excitement is FPV (First-Person View). Each drone has an on-board, fixed camera which transmits back a live video signal to your flying goggles. Because the camera is fixed and not gyro stabilized, you experience the full effect of acceleration and the roll of the horizon as you bank, twist and turn around the course.</p>
