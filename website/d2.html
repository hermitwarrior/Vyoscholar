            <h3>Types of Drones</h3>
            <div class="drone-types">
                <div class="type-card">
                    <h4>RTF (Ready To Fly)</h4>
                    <p>You'll be able to fly it more or less straight out of the box. Just charge the batteries and perhaps put on the rotor blades.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="type-card">
                    <h4>BNF (Bind-N-Fly)</h4>
                    <p>Sold as complete quadcopters but don't include the controller. You need to buy a separate handset controller.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="type-card">
                    <h4>ARF (Almost Ready to Fly)</h4>
                    <p>You will need to work on the drone before flying. This can mean assembling it or adding missing components.</p>

            <h3>Anatomy of a Drone</h3>
            <div class="anatomy-grid">
                <div class="part">
                    <h4>Battery</h4>
                    <p>Typically only powers the drone for 20 minutes per charge.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="part">
                    <h4>Rotors</h4>
                    <p>Shaped like aircraft wings to produce lift as air flows over them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="part">
                    <h4>GPS Aerial</h4>
                    <p>With GPS your drone knows exactly where it is and makes decisions based on that.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="part">
                    <h4>Booms</h4>
                    <p>The arms of your drone must be light but strong and thin enough to not interfere with rotor downdraft.</p>
                </div>

            <h3>Essential Safety Tips</h3>
            <ul class="safety-tips">
                <li>Ensure you never fly your drone near people's bodies and faces</li>
                <li>Switch off the drone's motor before the controller handset</li>
                <li>Remove the rotors when you're not using the UAV</li>
                <li>Don't risk flying unless weather conditions are good</li>
                <li>Follow instructions for recharging Lithium Polymer batteries</li>
            </ul>
