            <p>Drone filming is big news in media today. Almost every time you watch the news, there will be great sequences showing buildings and places from angles that would be impossible without drones.</p>

            <h3>Professional Camera Moves</h3>
            <div class="move">
                <h4>Tracking Shot</h4>
                <p>Gently move your drone past an object with the camera set at 45 degrees. The object appears in shot, then steadily moves out as you pass by.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="move">
                <h4>Panning</h4>
                <p>Swivel the camera horizontally while the drone stays still, just as you would turn your head to follow a passing car.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="move">
                <h4>Tilting</h4>
                <p>Take the camera from pointing at the horizon and slowly rotate it downwards, like looking over a cliff edge.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="move">
                <h4>Reveal Shot</h4>
                <p>Start looking vertically downwards, then tilt upwards to show the subject - a classic Hollywood move.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Editing Your Footage</h3>
            <p>Being organized is crucial for managing and editing your material. Create separate project folders for each shoot. Choose music that fits the pace and context of your film, avoiding clich√©d tracks. Edit your clips to fit the beat of the music, not vice versa.</p>

                    <h4>Pre-Roll</h4>
                    <p>Roll the camera for 5 seconds before starting your move, and hold for 5 seconds after. This gives editors "headroom".</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>Story First</h4>
                    <p>Even simple drone sequences should tell a story. Plan how your shots will flow together before filming.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>Sound Matters</h4>
                    <p>Good sound is 50% of a quality aerial sequence. Find royalty-free music that complements your visuals.</p>
